# Disease Simulation Project building and running instructions.

Run the first main method, `main1.cpp`:  
This program runs a simulation of the spread of a disease in a population when an infected 
person can spread the disease to people they come into contact with.

1. `icpc -o runMain1 infectiousDisease.cpp main1.cpp`  
2. `./runMain1`

Run the second main method, `main2.cpp`:  
This program runs a simulation of the spread of a disease in a population when an infected
person can spread the disease to only their neighbors.

1. `icpc -o runMain2 infectiousDisease.cpp main2.cpp`  
2. `./runMain2`
